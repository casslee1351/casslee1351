Originally from Oklahoma 🤠 Now based in Wichita, Kansas 🌻

I am mostly interested in mathematics, but I also love working on data science projects and developing video games. I also like to spend time and talk math and data science with my identical twin sister, Christi Lee ([@Honeybee-Lee](https://github.com/Honeybee-Lee)).
