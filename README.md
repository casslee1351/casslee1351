Hi, I’m Cassidy Lee, a master's student at Wichita State University studying mathematics with a focus in data science!
I am also a full-time data analyst for Textron Aviation based in Wichita, Kansas ✈️🌻.
I am interested in machine learning, with a focus on recommendation systems.
However, I love programming in general, so I work on a multitude of projects in my spare time!
